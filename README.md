# Good Morning Messages

After searching without sucess for a programmatically organised list of good morning messages, i decided to compile a short one myself😟.

## Why the list?

This list is very useful if you want to send your friend, boyfriend or girlfriend a good morning message programatically every morning😆. 

## To clone

```python
git clone https://github.com/kelechijio/Good-Morning-Messages.git
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Feel free to expand this list as you wish. Additions of new lists (example: goodnights) are welcomed too. Recreating the list as XML is also appreciated.
